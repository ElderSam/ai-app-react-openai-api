# JavaScript AI App with React and the OpenAI API

Integrated the OpenAI API into a JavaScript-based web app. I took a React-based weather app, adds  a heavy dose of AI, and created an interactive experience that knows what location you want weather information from, explains the weather data in simple language, and even suggests what to wear.
